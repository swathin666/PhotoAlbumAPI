Design and create a RESTful API in ASP.NET Core. The API should call, combine, and return these 2 API endpoints into a single HTTP response. The response should show the combined collection so that each Album contains a collection of its Photos. (i.e. photo.albumId == album.Id)
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums
Your API should consist of 2 operations; one to return all the data from the above endpoints, and one to return data relating to a single User Id. The design of the endpoints and schema of your API is up to you, but you must include all the data from the provided endpoints. You can find documentation for the endpoints here: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/
